*Gradually changing one feature of NonlinearICA model on MNIST, responsible for line thickness.*

## Authors

 - Daniil Cherniavskii (Nonlinear ICA part)
 - Ivan Matvienko (InfoGAN part)

## Requirements installation

The code was tested using Python 3.7.6; installing necessary dependancies is done by:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model training

To train Nonlinear ICA model and investigate what features may be mean, please refer to the [Nonlinear ICA](https://github.com/danchern97/GMML2021Project/blob/nonlinear_ica/nonlinear_ica/NonLinearICA.ipynb) notebook.

## Pretrained models

Already pretrained models for MNIST and CelebA can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_AehTiuZSL6mJ-9MEquCoZtRuB6t879q?usp=sharing).
